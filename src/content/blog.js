      '<p>Starting your own business or running one, is more than a full-time job. And while you are on top of everything, putting 100% of your efforts, you would not want a technological aspect to hinder the potential of your business. </p>\n<p>A good web design can do wonders to your business, and a bad one can exactly do the opposite. When most of your potential customers/ clients are present online, it is essential to have an identity of your business that represents you appropriately, that is, have a professional website for the win. </p>\n<p>A bad web design can affect your business as much as a bad office space- the analogy here holds true as both are the mediums via which the customers/clients come in to know about you, and then decide further to hire you as a service provider or not. </p>\n<h3 style="color:#F82626;"><b>Following are the effects of a bad website-</b></h3>\n<div class="reliable-issue"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.makemywebsite.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/user-experience.png"><noscript><img src="https://www.makemywebsite.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/user-experience.png"></noscript></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Inefficient User Experience &#038; Brand Image</b></p>\n<p>As they say, first impression is the last impression. In this era of technological wizardry, every customer is smart enough to Google you at first place, and then decide further. A bad web design, with unorganized graphics, cluttered or unnecessary content, too much whitespace or none at all, and unresponsive website design can widely affect your brand image and reputation, even when you provide top notch services in reality. Nowadays, user experience decides if you would get a heads up from the lead, who will be in front of the screen to know about you. With a bad website, bad user experience comes handy. Now that the user isn’t happy about the presentation, design, and the look of the website, he would jump onto your competitor’s website who may not be that efficient in work- but would nail the first impression! </p>\n</div>\n<div class="reliable-issue"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.makemywebsite.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/current-trends.png"><noscript><img src="https://www.makemywebsite.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/current-trends.png"></noscript></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>It seems as if you are unaware of current trends</b></p>\n<p>With so much advancement happening every day, it is important to stay updated and enhance the portals that speak for your business, one of which is your website! Let’s say for example, you have a website with relevant content optimized for the web, but if it is not responsive to the mobile or tablet users, you lose the show right there. To have an edge over others in your industry, your website design must be your top priority.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="reliable-issue"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.makemywebsite.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/reliability-issue-icon.png"><noscript><img src="https://www.makemywebsite.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/reliability-issue-icon.png"></noscript></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>It gives rise to reliability issues</b></p>\n<p>The users of your website, or your potential customers would not think twice before hitting the back button and never land again on your website because of an unimpressive design and layout. Your website is proof of how reliable you are as a business, and can put your customers as stake if it’s designed inefficiently. </p>\n<p>Experienced web designers at Make My Website are backed with experience and are updated with the current trends to make your website look stunning and professional.</p>\n</p></div>\n',

Every business needs a website in this era of technological advancement, and sooner or later almost every business would have one. Also, you get a legitimate point to advertise and surprise your clients with what “new” thing you’ve come up with, this Christmas.  </p>\n<p><strong><u>2- SEND NEWSLETTERS</u></strong><br />\nAs we always say, the key is to “engage”.

We are currently offering a whopping 25% off on web design and are getting a great response!</p>\n<p><strong><u>4- SOCIAL MEDIA OUTREACH</u></strong><br />\nEven when you’re off from work, make sure to share the bits and pieces of your holidays on your social media. Always remember, making relationships is more powerful than just advertising. Be it sharing a small boomerang of the Christmas tree at your place, or the décor in your nearest area, the aim is to engage, interact, and grow.</p>\n<p><strong><u>5- POST-HOLIDAY PLANS</u></strong><br />\nShare your post-holiday plans, or your new year resolutions for your business, workmanship, quality control, or enhanced customer service.</p>\n<p>You can also share last year resolutions that you have fulfilled. This way you’d create quality content that people would like to read in their fun time too. All you need to do is, draft a small article, get it published on your website, and share it everywhere on your social media or even in the newsletters.</p>\n',

      "<p><strong>1. Blog/News Page</strong><br />\nA blog or a news page on your website is a platform where you can publish informative articles about your industry or share the latest buzz in the same and updates in your business. Writing regular blogs for the website, say weekly, fortnightly, or even once a month, adds quality content to it which solely contributes to optimization for search engines.</p>\n<p>When regular content is added to any website, search engines analyze that the website is active, updated and is proving to be fruitful and productive for its users. When this happens, search engines automatically start giving preference to the websites with freshly generated content that aims at making a difference online.</p>\n<p>Now that being said, this content must be informative, excellent quality and must solve a purpose. If you include a blog page that doesn’t offer what it should, the result can be exactly opposite to what you anticipated, thanks to the smartest search engines of this digital era.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you are working on improving your ranking, make sure to include a blog page that gets fresh content from you every now and then, to be crawled by the search engines and get it indexed.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Social Media Sharing Buttons</strong><br />\nSocial media forms a major segment of your target audience. Be it any industry, most of your prospective customers have an active social media account running- which is associated with another big bunch of prospects who can be your potential buyers in the future. With every article you publish, or with every new project you add to your portfolio, make use of the social media links to share it on your respective handles. No wonder those who come across it and read it only to find it engaging and helpful- will certainly share it on their profiles. What does sharing do? Awareness? Yes, but most importantly, it creates BACKLINKS! Backlinks form a major part of the SEO and one of the main tasks whilst implementing SEO techniques is creating numerous backlinks. Now that some of them can be catered to with the help of social media, it is like an icing on the cake!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Alt Text for Images</strong><br />\nWe all know pictorial representations have been in for a long time now. Images are an easy yet effective way to convey the message and convince the users. Using alternative text or alt text for images largely contribute to SEO. It is always better to interpret the image effectively so that search engines can understand it in the right manner and rank you for the keywords you intend to. Images without alt text often tend amiss for getting ranked appropriately or certainly can just be ignored, hence, the sole purpose of including images on the website can go in vain if alt text is not included. Therefore, it is a must for a better ranking.</p>\n",
